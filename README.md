# MotionParallax

MotionParallax is a project that demonstrates the principles of motion parallax, a visual depth cue used in computer graphics and virtual environments. This tool simulates the effect where objects closer to the observer move faster across the field of view than objects farther away, enhancing the perception of depth in 2D scenes.

# Features
- Depth Simulation: Accurately simulates motion parallax to create a sense of depth in 2D environments.
- User Interaction: Allows users to interact with the scene and observe how motion parallax affects their perception of depth.
- Customizable Parameters: Adjust parameters like object speed and depth to explore different visual effects.
- Lightweight and Fast: Built for efficiency, ensuring smooth performance even in resource-constrained environments.

# Installation
To install MotionParallax, clone the repository and install any necessary dependencies:

git clone https://github.com/EduardoRamonHernandez/MotionParallax.git

cd MotionParallax # Install dependencies if needed

# Usage
To run MotionParallax, follow these steps:
1. Set up the environment by configuring the parameters in the settings file.
2. Run the main script to start the simulation.
3. Use the controls to interact with the scene and observe the effects of motion parallax.

python motion_parallax.py
